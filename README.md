# Geosoft GX Core C/C++ Repository

This is the repository for Geosoft GX Developer support for C/C++ development. It contains headers, libraries and dlls as well as  samples illustrating how to use the APIs.

At its heart the GX API is exposed as a low level C API that is version stable. This repository also provides a header only C++ wrapper that could be used to write cleaner and simpler code than using the API directly.

Refer to the documentation for more information.
